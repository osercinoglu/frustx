"""How much of the decoy energy variance is irreducible packer noise?

THE QUESTION THIS GATES. Roughly 28% of the within-contact decoy energy variance is not
explained by the identity of the contacting pair. The pair-local decoy proposal
(scripts/local_decoy.py) is motivated by the hope that this residue is CONTEXT -- the
other 90-odd% of the sequence being shuffled too -- and that freezing the environment
would recover it as signal.

But there is a second candidate that would make the whole idea worthless: the packer.
Rosetta is initialised without -constant_seed (frustx/energies.py:37), so building the
SAME sequence twice gives two different rotamer assignments and two different energies.
If most of the non-pair variance is that, then no decoy-locality scheme recovers anything,
because the variance is not information about context at all -- it is Monte-Carlo noise in
the side-chain packing.

THE MEASUREMENT. Rebuild ONE fixed decoy sequence R times and measure the spread of e_ij
across repeats. That is packer noise with sequence and context both held exactly constant.
Compare it to the total spread across different decoy sequences from the existing tensor.

    packer_var / total_var  near 1  ->  the residue is noise; locality recovers nothing
    packer_var / total_var  near 0  ->  the residue is context; locality has something
