"""Tunable defaults, kept free of heavy imports.

This module exists so `frustx --help` does not have to load PyRosetta. The CLI needs
these values to build its argument parser; importing them from decoys.py or
frustration.py would drag in PyRosetta (~2.5 s) just to print usage text.

Nothing here may import pyrosetta, numpy or Bio.

# "relax" is the more literal reading -- FastRelax is Monte-Carlo based, minimisation is

#
# WHAT ENERGY GOES INTO Eq. 1, as opposed to how much background is mixed into it
# (DEFAULT_BACKGROUND_WEIGHT, above). The two are orthogonal knobs and are easy to
# confuse: `background_weight` changes the *definition* of a contact energy E_ij;
# `readout` changes *which set of contact energies* Eq. 1 is applied to.
#
#   "pair"          E_ij alone -- what the paper's Eq. 1 scores, and FrustX's default.
#   "neighbourhood" E_ij plus every other contact energy touching i or j.
#
# "neighbourhood" exists because it is what frustratometeR actually sums. Its mutational
# decoy energy is not a pair energy at all: fix_backbone.cpp:5214-5243 sums
# water(i,j) + burial_i + burial_j + sum_k water(i,k) + sum_k water(j,k). Comparing
# FrustX's bare pair energy against that is a scope mismatch, not just a force-field
# difference, and it is the single largest identified driver of the two tools'
# disagreement -- larger than the whole background-weight sweep.
#
# It is NOT the default, and should not become one on current evidence: the
# neighbourhood readout is ~94% reducible to a residue-additive function, i.e. it buys
# agreement partly by becoming the same kind of degenerate quantity that w=1 does. It is
# provided so the scope axis can be measured separately from the force-field axis.
# See "Readout scope" in docs/method.md.

# --- Contact representative atom ----------------------------------------------------
#
# "CA" is the paper's definition, quoted in contacts.py, and stays the default so runs
# remain comparable with everything measured so far.
#
# MEASURED CASE FOR "CB", recorded so the default can be revisited deliberately rather
# than drifting. A Ca-Ca cutoff admits pairs whose side chains point away from each
# other, for which no REF2015 term fires at all: across the six GTPase runs, 1824 of 7687
# contacts (23.7%) have decoy sigma <= 0.02, and Eq. 1 is then 0/0 or near it. Those
# contacts are genuinely less reliable, not merely quiet -- split-half reliability on
# 1XTQ is 0.897 for them against 0.988 for the rest.
#
# At MATCHED contact counts CB separates the dead pairs better than either alternative
# tested (~4000 contacts kept: 0.4% dead by CB, 1.8% by minimum heavy-atom distance,
# 3.1% by CA). It beats minimum heavy-atom distance because CB encodes side-chain
# DIRECTION -- two residues can have close backbones while their side chains point apart.
#
#   CA <= 10.0 (current) 7687 kept, 23.7% dead
#   CB <=  9.5 (fR's)    5713 kept,  6.0% dead
#   CB <=  9.0           5103 kept,  3.0% dead
#   CB <=  8.5           4532 kept,  1.0% dead
#
# This is also part of why FrustX and frustratometeR disagree on which contacts exist at
# all (475 vs 389 on 1UBQ, only 344 shared). See "Contact definition" in docs/method.md.
