"""Tests for regeneration keys.

The point of a key is negative: it must REFUSE work produced under different settings.
So most of these assert that two keys differ, and the ones that assert equality are the
ones guarding against over-invalidation -- a key that changes when nothing relevant
changed is not safe, it is just useless, because it throws away expensive work.

No PyRosetta needed; provenance.py is stdlib-only on purpose.
