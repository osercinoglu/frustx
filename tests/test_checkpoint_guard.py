"""The checkpoint resume guard in scripts/dump_decoy_samples.py.

This is a test of a SCRIPT, which is unusual here, and it earns the exception: the thing
being guarded is a silent corruption of a multi-hour decoy tensor. Before the guard, the
resume check compared two numbers -- decoy count and residue count -- so resuming a `min`
checkpoint with `relax` on the command line passed it, mixed two ensembles into one
tensor, and left the native reference pinned to the first protocol while every
post-resume decoy used the second.

The checkpoint is FABRICATED here rather than produced by a real run. A real run writes
one only every CHECKPOINT_EVERY=25 decoys, so producing one honestly would mean building
25 decoys per test. What matters is the file's contents, and those are written out
explicitly below -- which also means this test states the on-disk format in one place.
